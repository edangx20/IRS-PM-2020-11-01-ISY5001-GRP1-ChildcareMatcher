## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Choosing a child care centre for your little one is an important decision. If you are putting
your child into care for the first time, it may be a stressful experience since you want what’s
best for your child, but you don’t know where to start. It’s your child’s early experiences that
will have a lasting impact on their future habits and resilience. This is why choosing a quality
child care centre is essential.

Various aspects in choosing the best option includes determining the type of childcare service we are
looking for, to find out the childcare services' philosophy and values, the teaching methods and learning
activities that the child care centres encompass, the location of the centres, the type of meals
given to the children and most importantly the child’s safety. How to tell if a childcare centre
isn’t right for your child? Possibly by the reviews that we read on various forums to prevent
ending up in a wrong childcare that is not suitable for your little one.

Our team, comprising of four members, two among us are new parents, have faced these challenges
and found the process hectic while choosing the best childcare for our little one. However to
simplify this decision process we have chosen to create a recommendation system for the
parents to key in their preferences and get the recommendations in one click without the need
to surf through various forum discussion to get the reviews and other factors like choosing food
and distance etc.

Our system aids for both the parents in choosing the child care centres as well as the child care
centre in optimizing their waitlist for admission. We have performed the knowledge
acquisition by short interviews through emails to the child care centres on our product. We
have used the techniques and knowledge gained through lectures and hands-on experience to build this
system, incorporate the KIE DROOLS for building the recommendation system and
PYTHON FLASK for a UI integrating both the systems, Google APIs for distance and sentiment
analysis of scrapped reviews. 

We had regular online meetings to discuss our progress, our team had challenging time
sharing knowledge and helping out without physically meeting to accomplish tasks together
due to the Covid-19 situation. Overall, we have good learning experience from each of the team member.
We are overwhelmed with joy and gratitude to our lecturers and would like to share the
insights of this project.
